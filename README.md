üìñ Full documentation on [https://docs.dpaste.org](https://docs.dpaste.org)


dpaste is a [pastebin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) application written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework. You can find a live installation on [dpaste.org.](https://dpaste.org)

The project is intended to run standalone as any regular Django Project, but it's also possible to install it into an existing project as a typical Django application.


The code is open source and available on Github: [https://github.com/darrenofficial/dpaste](https://github.com/darrenofficial/dpaste). If you found bugs, have problems or ideas with the project or the website installation, please create an *Issue* there.

‚ö†Ô∏è dpaste requires at a minimum Python 3.6 and Django 2.2.
