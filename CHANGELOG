Changelog
=========

3.0 (master)
-------------

* General code cleanup
* Removed jQuery, all Javascript is native.
* Removed Bootstrap for theming.
* Django 1.11 based templates, forms, views, models, etc.
* All views are now class based and use the latest generic based views sugar.
* Removed "Suspicious" middleware which was never been used, documented, 
  and also not functional for a while.
* Fixed CMD+Enter form submission shortcut in Firefox. 

2.13 (2017-01-20)
-----------------

* (Backwards incompatible) Removal of django-mptt and therefor the removal of a
  tree based snippet list, due to performance reasons with large snippet counts.
  Snippets still have a 'parent' relation if it's an answer of another snippet,
  however this is no longer a Nested Set. The UI is simplified too and the user
  can now only compare an answer to it's parent snippet. I believe this is the
  major use case anyway.
* (Backwards incompatible) Removal of the "Gist" button feature.
* Fixed broken 404 view handler in Django 1.9+.
* Python 3.6 and Django 1.10 compatibility and tests.

2.12 (2016-09-06)
-----------------

* Fixed "Content Type" problem with Django 1.10.
* Development requirements now use a different version scheme to be
  compatible with older `pip` versions.

-----------------

* Django 1.10 Support

-----------------

* Dropped Django 1.4 and 1.7 support!
* Full Django 1.8 support
* Full Django 1.9 support
* C++ Lexer is enabled by default
* (Backwards incompatible) All API calls must pass the data within a POST
  request. It can't mix POST and GET arguments anymore. This was weird behavior

----------------

* Full Django 1.7 support
* Full Django 1.8 support

* More settings can be overrridden, like the jQuery URL, site name and wether
  you want to enable Gthub Gist.

  by default.

  ``code`` lexer.
