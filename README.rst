The project is intended to run standalone as any regular Django Project,
but it's also possible to install it into an existing project as a typical
Django application.

The code is open source and available on Github: https://github.com/bartTC/dpaste.
If you found bugs, have problems or ideas with the project or the website installation,
please create an *Issue* there.

‚ö†Ô∏è dpaste requires at a minimum Python 3.6 and Django 2.2.
