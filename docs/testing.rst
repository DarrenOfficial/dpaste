=============================
Testing and local development
=============================

dpaste is continuously tested on Travis_. You can also run the test
suite locally with tox_::

    $ cd dpaste/
    $ pip install tox
    $ tox --skip-missing-interpreters

A more manual approach is installing it all by hand in a virtual environment.
This is also the preferred way to setup an environment for local development::

    $ cd dpaste/
    $ pipenv install --three --dev
    $ pipenv run python runtests.py
