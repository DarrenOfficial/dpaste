====================
Settings to override
====================

When dpaste is installed as a standalone service or integrated into an existing
project there are various settings you can override to adjust dpaste's
behavior without touching the code:

.. glossary::

    ``DPASTE_SLUG_LENGTH``
        Integer. Length of the random slug for each new snippet. In the rare
        case an existing slug is generated again, the length will increase by
        one more character.
        Default: ``4``

    ``DPASTE_SLUG_CHOICES``
        String. A string of characters which are used to create the random slug.
        Default: ``abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890``

    ``DPASTE_LEXER_DEFAULT``
        String. The lexer key that is pre-selected in the dropdown. Note that
        this is only used if the user has not saved a snippet before, otherwise
        we use the last-used lexer. Default: ``python``

    ``DPASTE_MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH``
        Integer. Maximum number of bytes per snippet. Default: ``250 * 1024 * 1024``

    ``DPASTE_MAX_SNIPPETS_PER_USER``
        Integer. Maximum number of snippets we save in teh user session and
        display on the history page. Default: ``10``

    ``DPASTE_BASE_URL``
        String. The full qualified hostname and path to the dpaste instance.
        This is used to generate a link in the API response. Default: ``https://dpaste.de``

    ``DPASTE_LEXER_LIST``
        Choices. A tuple of choices of Pygments lexers used in the lexer
        dropdown. Here is the full `lexer list`_ which is currently used.
        Example::

            DPASTE_LEXER_LIST = (
                ('delphi', 'Delphi'),
                ('php', 'PHP'),
                ('text', 'Text'),
            )

    ``DPASTE_EXPIRE_CHOICES``
        Choices. A tuple of seconds and a descriptive string used in the lexer
        expiration dropdown. Example::

            from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
            DPASTE_EXPIRE_CHOICES = (
                (3600, _(u'In one hour')),
                (3600 * 24 * 7, _(u'In one week')),
                (3600 * 24 * 30, _(u'In one month')),
                (3600 * 24 * 30 * 12 * 100, _(u'100 Years')),
            )

        **One-Time snippets** are supported. One-Time snippets are automatically
        deleted once a defined view count has reached (Default: ``2``). To
        enable one-time snippets you have to add a choice ``onetime`` to the
        expire choices::

            from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
            DPASTE_EXPIRE_CHOICES = (
                ('onetime', _(u'One-Time snippet')),
                (3600, _(u'In one hour')),
                (3600 * 24 * 7, _(u'In one week')),
                (3600 * 24 * 30, _(u'In one month')),
            )

        You can also set the maximum view count after what the snippet gets
        deleted. The default is ``2``. One view is from the author, one view
        is from another user::

            DPASTE_ONETIME_LIMIT = 2

        **Infinite snippets** are supported. You can keep snippets forever when
        you set the choice key to ``never``. The management command will ignore
        these snippets::

            from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
            DPASTE_EXPIRE_CHOICES = (
                (3600, _(u'In one hour')),
                (u'never', _(u'Never')),
            )

    ``DPASTE_EXPIRE_DEFAULT``
        The key of the default value of ``DPASTE_EXPIRE_CHOICES``. Default:
        ``3600 * 24 * 30 * 12 * 100`` or simpler: ``DPASTE_EXPIRE_CHOICES[2][0]``.

    ``DPASTE_ENABLE_GIST``
        **Removed in Version 2.13!**
        Boolean. Whether to display the Gist button for re-pasting to GitHub.
        Default: ``True``

        ..warning: This feature was removed in v2.11.

    ``DPASTE_DEFAULT_GIST_NAME``
        **Removed in Version 2.13!**
        String. The filename used when pasting a snippet on Github Gist.
        Default: ``dpaste.de_snippet.py``

    ``DPASTE_DEFAULT_GIST_DESCRIPTION``
        **Removed in Version 2.13!**
        String. The filename used when pasting a snippet on Github Gist.
        Default: ``dpaste.de_snippet.py``

    ``DPASTE_JQUERY_URL``
        String. URL to use for jQuery.
        Default: ``//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js``
